## 🚀 Next Steps - Deploy to GitHub!

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: Choose a name (e.g., `my-portfolio`, `cybersecurity-portfolio`)
3. **Description**: "My Cybersecurity Portfolio Website"
4. **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
5. **DO NOT** check any initialization options
6. Click **Create repository**

### Step 2: Push Your Code

Run these commands in order:

```bash
# Stage all files
git add .

# Commit everything
git commit -m "feat: Setup GitHub Pages deployment with automated CI/CD"

# Add your GitHub repository (REPLACE with your actual repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name!

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - **Source**: Select **GitHub Actions** ⚠️ (not "Deploy from branch")
5. GitHub will automatically detect and run the workflow

### Step 4: Wait and Access

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Watch the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow run (~2 minutes)
3. Once complete, your site will be live at:
   ```
   https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/
   ```

## 🎯 Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev
